# Plutonke
Plutonke is a free native Android app that provides an easy way to track your day-to-day expenses

This app is a work in progress but the code in this branch is ready to go!

If you have any ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue!

## Techonologies

This app uses Kotlin as its primary Frontend language and the framework Jetpack Compose for building its visual components.

## Installation

As we mentioned before, this app is still in development, so it isn't in the Play Store. 

If you want to test it anyway follow these steps:

1. Install Kotlin along with Android Studio on your computer 

2. Clone this repository and the backend repository (you can find it [here](https://github.com/franjuarez/Plutonke-server))
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/franjuarez/Plutonke-server
      git clone https://github.com/franjuarez/Plutonke
    ```

3. Run the backend repository using the go run command.

     In Windows:
     ```bash
      go run .\main
     ```
    In Linux:
    ```bash
      go run ./main
    ```

5.  Open the Frontend folder as a project in Android Studio.

6. Once on Android Studio choose the device of your preference and run the project using the "Play" button.
